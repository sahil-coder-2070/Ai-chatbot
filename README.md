# Sahil Singh AI Project — Chatbot UI

This is a **modern AI Chatbot User Interface** designed for a smooth, professional, and responsive experience.  
It provides the front-end for a chatbot app — styled with **dark theme, gradients, and responsive layout**.  

---

## 🎯 Overview

The chatbot UI is divided into two main parts:  

1. **Sidebar (Left Panel)** → For managing chats, new sessions, and settings.  
2. **Main Chat Area (Right Panel)** → For conversation between user and AI.  

This separation makes it easy to navigate, manage conversations, and interact with the AI.
